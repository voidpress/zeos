"""Two kernels, one process -- ZEOS-Distributed's D1.

> Two kernel instances with distinct priority spaces bridged by an in-process

This module is the harness, and it lives beside ``driver.py`` rather than in ``core``
because advancing a link and moving frames between two kernels is I/O in every sense
that matters: it is where time is supplied and where arrival order is decided.

**The kernels do not know about each other.** Each holds its own scheduler, its own
suspension stack, and its own priority space; neither can preempt the other, because
preemption is defined at a token boundary and a token boundary is an event on one
node's machine. The only thing crossing is a pipe write, which arrives an RTT late
and lands as ordinary input. That is not a limitation to engineer away -- it is the
same structure as a classical OS, where you do not preempt a process on another
machine, you send it a message.
