"""The syscall ABI: the small command language a model speaks to the kernel, declared once.

A model asks the kernel for things by emitting text such as ``write stdout hello;``. Which
words exist, what each one means to the kernel, and how a command ends are declared here
as data, so that the prose a model is told, the pattern a reply is searched with, and any
grammar a sampler is constrained by are all renderings of the same declaration rather
than copies of it.

Nothing here knows how a model is made to obey. A backend that can constrain sampling
renders a grammar from the ABI; one that cannot puts ``prose()`` in its prompt and finds
the command with ``pattern()``.
