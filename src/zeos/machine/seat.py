"""The seat: what sits between a model and the kernel, whatever the model is.

A backend that runs a real model has three jobs the kernel does not do for it: chop what
the model says into one token per decode, notice the token that completes a command and
turn that command into a kernel request, and hand the model its own transcript afresh
each time it is asked to speak -- afresh, because the kernel rewrites status regions and
evicts spans in place, so a copy kept alongside drifts.

``SyscallSeat`` is that machinery with no model in it. ``CommandSeat`` adds a
``CommandSource`` -- a tape, an API, a local process -- and is a whole backend. A backend
that samples token by token, as local weights do, inherits ``SyscallSeat`` and does its own
decoding. Neither knows the words of the ABI: those come from a ``SyscallABI``.
