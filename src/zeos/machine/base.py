"""The machine backend: the five ops, block boundaries, masking, attention.

This is the most important interface in the system, because it is the one M1 swaps
for a real paged-KV serving stack. Everything above it -- scheduler, segments,
integrity, paging -- is written against this and nothing else.

The contract mirrors the four asks ZEOS makes of a serving stack, which is the whole
point: the four things ZEOS needs from a serving stack are (a) an allowed-block
bitmap fed to attention, (b) per-segment attention mass aggregated per block,
(c) reserved-token control in tokenizer and sampler, and (d) grammar-constrained
decoding for endorser schemas. All four appear here, so a backend that satisfies
this interface satisfies the spec.

Division of responsibility, which is easy to get wrong:

* The **machine** owns the materialised token sequence and its blocks. It knows
  offsets and lengths, and it enforces the mask.
* The **kernel** owns the segment table, rings, integrity, and residency. Segment
  metadata is PCB state, not context.

They meet at token offsets. The machine reports what it did; the kernel decides
what it means.

Attention mass returned by a backend that cannot measure it (i.e. M0) is
**synthetic**. See ``ScriptedMachine`` -- it is enough to validate mechanism and is
not evidence about policy.
