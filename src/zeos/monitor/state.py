"""The fold: a journal becomes a picture of the system.

The design already commits to *"kernel state is a fold over this sequence"* (tech
spec's "journal is the source of truth" rule). A monitor is that fold,
rendered -- which is why this module adds no
kernel instrumentation at all. Three things follow, and they are the reason to build
it this way rather than by reaching into a live ``Kernel``:

* **Live and post-mortem are the same operation.** Tailing a running kernel's journal
  and replaying a recorded one differ only in where the lines come from.
* **A recorded run can be scrubbed.** Determinism is already a gate, so stepping
  backwards and forwards through an incident is exact rather than approximate. That
  is the difference between a dashboard and something you can drive.
* **The monitor is testable like everything else.** It is a pure function from a list
  of events to a snapshot, so it is covered by pytest rather than by looking at it.

**What this is not.** It is not a second source of truth. Anything the monitor
reports that the journal does not carry would be a fact nobody can verify after the
fact, so if a pane needs a number, the number needs an event. Building this surfaced
two places where that was not true -- ``JobSpawned`` carried no owner, and a job's
starting integrity appeared nowhere -- and the fix was to journal them, not to reach
around the journal for them.

The headline the top strip is built around is deliberate:

    12 jobs alive · 1 decoding · 1 forward pass/tick

That line *is* the design's central economic claim, made visible. Classical ``top``
leads with %CPU because a blocked process still occupies a scheduling slot; here a
blocked job costs nothing, and the gap between "alive" and "decoding" is the whole
argument.
