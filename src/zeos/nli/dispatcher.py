"""The dispatcher: compile, gate, echo back, dispatch.

An ordinary descriptor in the real design -- "pinned at moderate priority in the fleet
kernel". Here it is a kernel-side function for the same reason the allocator's default
is a plain class: N0 is about whether the *gates* hold, and putting the dispatcher
inside a job would add a scheduling story without adding a safety one. What it must
share with the eventual job version is that it holds no authority of its own; it reads
an envelope and asks the kernel.

The ordering of the five layers is the substance of this module, so it is worth
restating why it is an ordering rather than a set. The layers run hardest-first, and
the first four never consult the model's opinion:

1. **Authority** -- the compiled job runs at the *speaker's* capability envelope.
   Eloquence is not an input to this check.
2. **Priority** -- the ceiling is configuration. "NOW, drop everything" is a request.
3. **Addressability** -- some things have no compilation target at all.
4. **Device gates** -- schemas, rate limits, interlocks, and action gates on the way
   out.
5. **Judgment** -- the dispatcher may refuse, confirm, or escalate. Valuable,
   trainable, and explicitly not load-bearing.

Addressability is checked during compilation (there is nothing to dispatch), device
gates are checked at the write boundary (that is where the actuation is), and this
module owns authority and priority. Judgment appears here as ``confirm`` and as the
right to refuse -- deliberately last, deliberately soft, and deliberately not the thing
the safety case rests on.

**Authority narrowing is not refusal.** A job whose speaker lacks the barrier
capability is dispatched *without* it, and faults when it reaches for the actuator.
That is the faithful reading of the authority layer -- "the job does not hold the capability and the
write raises a capability fault" -- and it is also the stronger demonstration: the
barrier stays shut because of the capability boundary, not because the dispatcher had
an opinion. A dispatcher that refused up front would be doing the work of layer five
and hiding whether layer one works at all.
