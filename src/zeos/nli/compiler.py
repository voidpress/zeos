"""Compilation: from what someone said to an artifact that faces the gates.

> **Instructions are compiled, not obeyed.**

The compiler turns an utterance into a discrete, inspectable artifact -- an invocation
of an existing descriptor, a mission tree, or a candidate descriptor for the loader --
and that artifact then faces every gate any program faces.

**This module is deliberately the untrusted component**, and that is worth being
explicit about, because it is easy to mistake for a weakness. In N0 compilation is a
template match over descriptor-declared phrasings; at N1 it is a language model. The
demonstration NLI exists to make is not about the compiler being reliable -- it is
about what happens *after* compilation, which is why judgment is the fifth of five
layers and the first four "do not consult the model's opinion". A trivially fooled
compiler and a persuaded LLM produce the same class of artifact, and both meet the
same four gates. Making the N0 compiler cleverer would demonstrate nothing extra;
making it *trusted* would demonstrate nothing at all.

**Addressability is opt-in, per descriptor.** A descriptor becomes reachable by voice
only by declaring ``utterances:``. This is the structural form of addressability:

> "Disable collision avoidance" has no compilation target… the reflex tier contains
> no LLM -- there is nothing there to persuade. The most safety-critical layer is not
> protected from natural language; it is *deaf* to it.

An opt-in list makes deafness the default and hearing the declared exception, which
is the right way round: a blacklist of forbidden phrasings would have to anticipate
every way of asking, and the interesting attacks are the phrasings nobody
anticipated. There is nothing to anticipate if the only reachable descriptors are the
ones that put their hand up.
