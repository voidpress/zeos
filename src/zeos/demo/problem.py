"""Demonstration problems, and the contract that separates them from solutions.

A **problem** is a world: what exists, what the sensors report, what the actuators
accept, what happens and when, and what counts as success. It contains no
behaviours. A **solution** is a descriptor tree that tries to handle it. The two are
loaded from separate directories and are independently versionable, so the same
problem can be attempted by many solutions and a solution can be re-run against a
harder scenario.

The interface between them is the **pipe contract**, and that is not an invention of
this module -- it is what the design already says a pipe is::

    Pipes are the function signature: what this behaviour consumes and produces. A
    descriptor that reads ``door.sensor`` and writes ``user.notifications`` composes
    with anything speaking those pipes -- the author of either side needs to know the
    pipe's schema, not the other author.
                                                    -- the ZEOS Programming Model

So the split falls out of the architecture rather than being imposed on it:

* the **problem** owns ``pipes`` and ``world-state`` -- the environment;
* the **solution** owns ``descriptors``, ``vectors``, and ``boot`` -- the behaviour;
* a solution that ships its own ``pipes.yaml`` is rejected, because it would be
  defining the world it is supposed to be tested against.

That last rule is the one that keeps the suite honest. Without it a solution can
quietly widen its own environment -- declare the actuator it wishes existed, or
downgrade a ring-3 feed to ring 2 -- and pass by changing the question.
