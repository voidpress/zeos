"""Testing one behaviour on its own.

The unit smaller than the whole system exists again, and this is its harness:
run a single descriptor against scripted pipes, assert on
its pipe writes. Deterministic given a seed, cheap enough for CI, and needing no
other behaviour, no world, and no GPU -- the gas handler is tested by firing
synthetic gas events at it.

This lives in ``src/`` rather than in ``tests/`` because solution authors need it.
A behaviour is a unit of *authorship*, so it has to be a unit of testing too, and
that is only true if the harness ships with the runtime rather than with our
test suite.

Contract-tier fuzzing is the same harness with adversarial inputs: feed a descriptor
an injection corpus on a ring-3 pipe and assert the MP fault behaviour, rather than
reading the transcript and forming an impression.
