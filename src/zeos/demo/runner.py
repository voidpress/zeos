"""Binding a solution to a problem, running it, and scoring it.

The three steps are deliberately separate:

1. **bind** -- check the solution against the problem's contract and assemble a
   kernel. Fails loudly and *before* the scenario, so a solution that cannot work
   says why rather than scoring zero mysteriously.
2. **run** -- drive the scenario. The problem owns the event schedule and the
   simulated cost of a token boundary; the solution owns nothing about time, so it
   cannot buy its own latency.
3. **score** -- evaluate criteria against the journal.

This is the reusable interface. Adding a problem means writing YAML and a scenario;
adding a solution means writing descriptors; neither requires touching this module,
and the same solution can be scored against a harder scenario without modification.

Architecture:
    Calls: Kernel, Driver.run, Criterion.evaluate
