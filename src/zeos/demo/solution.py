"""A solution: a descriptor tree, and nothing else.

A solution directory looks like a case directory minus the environment. It has
``goals/``, ``handlers/``, ``services/``, ``guards/`` and a ``system/`` holding
``vectors.yaml`` and ``boot.yaml`` -- but no ``pipes.yaml`` and no
``world-state.yaml``, because those belong to the problem.

The omission is load-bearing rather than tidy. A solution that could declare its own
pipes could give itself the actuator it wished existed, or quietly re-ring a hostile
feed from 3 to 2 and make the injection problem disappear. ``declares_environment``
exists so the harness can refuse that, and refuse it with an explanation.

Loading reuses ``zeos.descriptor.loader`` rather than reimplementing it, so a solution
and a standalone case parse through exactly the same path.
