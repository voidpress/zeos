"""Success criteria, evaluated from the journal.

Every criterion is a structural fact about a run, not a judgement about a
transcript. That is the same discipline the test tiers use, and for the same
reason: "the alarm preempted supervision within one boundary" is
checkable, whereas "the response looks sensible" is not.

A criterion carries a ``because``: the sentence explaining why the problem author
thinks this matters. It is printed on failure, so a scorecard reads as an argument
rather than a list of red crosses -- and writing it forces the problem author to know
what they are actually testing.

Two criteria are worth singling out:

* ``latency`` measures **event-to-first-corrective-action**, which is the number the
  safety case actually cares about and the one the placement rule compares against a
  link. Not dispatch latency, not first token -- first
  *action*.
* ``never_written_above_integrity`` asserts that a privileged effect never happened
  while the acting job was tainted. It is how a problem states "a ring-3 vendor feed
  must be structurally incapable of moving the plant", and it passes or fails on the
  capability check rather than on anybody's good intentions.
