"""The append-only journal.

Kernel state is a fold over this sequence. The kernel core never touches a file --
it emits events and the driver appends them here -- so the core stays pure while the
journal stays authoritative.

Sequence numbers are assigned on append rather than carried by events: an event is
a fact, its sequence number is a position, and only the journal knows positions.
