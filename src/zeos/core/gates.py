"""Action gates: the semantic check on the way *out*.

Capability checks are **syntactic** -- which pipes -- and NLI is honest that this leaves
a residual:

> A composition of individually-permitted actions can be dangerous (the job
> legitimately holds the lift actuator; it lifts the beam over the walkway).

An action gate is the endorser pattern pointed at output instead of input.
An endorser stands between untrusted content and a job's context and may refuse to
let content in; a gate stands between a job's intended actuation and the device pipe
and may refuse to let it out. Same shape, opposite direction, and the same reason for
existing: the judgment lives in

> a small, auditable, separately-owned file -- the safety team's file -- rather than
> diffused through every task.

**Gates are jobs.** Not kernel policy, not a callback, not a config predicate: an
ordinary descriptor, spawned by the kernel, budgeted, schedulable, preemptible or
pinned as its latency demands, and testable in CI by firing synthetic plans at it. That
matters for three reasons. It means the gate's own reasoning is journaled like any
other job's. It means a gate that hangs is a *scheduling* problem the kernel already
knows how to describe, rather than a novel deadlock. And it means the safety team can
write a gate with the same tools as everyone else, which is the difference between a
mechanism people use and a mechanism people work around.

The held write reuses ``pending_write`` -- the same parking spot backpressure uses.
A write waiting for a verdict and a write waiting for buffer space are the same
situation from the job's point of view: it asked to act, it has not acted yet, and it
is descheduled until it can. Nothing new was needed. A write arriving from outside
-- a peer node's frame, a device adapter -- has no job to park on, so the kernel
holds it itself until the verdict lands.
