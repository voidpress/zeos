"""Holdable resources: mutexes, semaphores, and the things leases will be built on.

Core §2.2 names four kinds of resource a job can block on -- "tool, actuator, pipe,
lock" -- and until now the kernel modelled exactly one of them. Priority inheritance
was therefore wired to pipes and nothing else, and three separate parts of the
design were waiting on the same missing subsystem:

* the design's **multi-threaded extension** needs mutexes, semaphores, and atomics
  for concurrent jobs;
* **ZEOS-Fleet** needs physical mutexes -- doorways, corridors, cranes, charging
  docks -- with capacities and a *global* lock graph;
* **ZEOS-Fleet** defines an embodiment lease as "a resource in the core §2.2
  sense -- held, blocked-on, and subject to priority inheritance".

One table serves all three. That is the whole argument for building it before the
allocator: leases are defined in terms of resources, so building F0 first would
mean building the resource concept *inside* the allocator, where the multi-threaded
extension and the fleet layer cannot reach it.

Two properties are load-bearing and easy to lose:

**Capacity, not just exclusion.** A corridor might admit two. A mutex is the
degenerate case where capacity is one, not a separate mechanism.

**Deadlock is detected, not avoided by hope.** Because every hold and every wait
lives in one table, the wait-for graph is complete and cycles are findable. The
Fleet design is explicit that the response is "a loud scheduler fault naming the cycle" --
so the cycle itself is part of the fault, not something an operator reconstructs.
