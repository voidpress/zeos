"""The allocator: which body serves which task, and on what terms.

The Fleet design is unusually explicit about what this module is *not*:

> Allocation -- which body serves which task -- is a matching problem with fifty
> years of literature… ZEOS-Fleet deliberately does not pick a winner. The
> **allocator is a policy module** with a kernel-defined contract.

So ``AllocatorPolicy`` is a protocol with a deliberately dull default, and what the
kernel owns is the set of invariants *around* allocation:

* every grant is a **lease**, and every lease is revocable under its declared
  release policy;
* every revocation is a **suspension, not a loss** -- the job keeps its transcript
  and resumes in another body;
* allocation respects the priority space: preempting a body follows the same rule
  as preempting tokens;
* deadlock over bodies and locks is detectable, because leases are ordinary
  resources in the one table (R0);
* starvation is surfaced -- a mission bounced off bodies more than K times raises
  the same fault a starved job does.

**A lease is a resource, not a new mechanism.** That is the whole reason R0 came
first: ``body:carrier-7`` is a capacity-1 resource, so it inherits blocking,
priority inheritance, cycle detection, and the wait-for graph without any of them
being re-implemented here. What this module adds is *matching*, *revocation*, and
*gangs*.
