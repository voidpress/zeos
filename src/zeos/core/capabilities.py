"""Capabilities: a job's only effects are pipe writes, and every write is checked.

Pipes are held as capabilities granted in the descriptor, not as ambient authority
The check at every write is the analogue of a syscall permission check, and
it is the layer that still holds when everything above it has failed -- a fully
persuaded model reaching for the mail pipe hits this and stops.

The check::

    check_write(job, cap, payload):
      assert cap in job.capabilities                       else CAPABILITY_FAULT
      eff = max(job.current_integrity, cap.session_floor)  # deputy rule
      assert eff <= cap.min_integrity                      else PRIVILEGE_FAULT
      assert payload matches cap.schema                    else CAPABILITY_FAULT
      assert cap.rate.admit(now)                           else CAPABILITY_FAULT

**Schema width is the security dial.** An endorser that may emit only
``{price: number, in_stock: bool}`` smuggles almost nothing; one that may emit
``{summary: string(2000)}`` smuggles plenty. Because that is a
quantitative claim, ``Schema.capacity_bits`` computes an upper bound on how much
attacker-chosen information can cross the boundary -- turning "narrow enough" from a
judgement call into a number a reviewer can argue with. This is a first cut at
OQ-3, not a settled answer: the bound is an information-theoretic ceiling, not a
demonstration that an attacker can achieve it.

Schemas are validated here rather than by a JSON-schema dependency because the core
stays stdlib-only, and because a deliberately small schema language is the point --
an expressive one would make the capacity bound incomputable, which would defeat
the mechanism it exists to support.
