"""Fixed-priority preemptive scheduling, and the suspension stack.

Three rules from core Appendix A drive everything here:

1. The highest-priority job dispatches; ties break FIFO. The candidates are the
   ``READY`` set **and the top of the suspension stack**: a job does not stop
   holding its priority because something interrupted it, and an interrupted job
   wins a tie, because it is mid-work where a ready job is between pieces of work.
2. ``RUNNING → SUSPENDED`` happens only via preemption and ``RUNNING → BLOCKED``
   only via pipe ops. **There is no yield** -- jobs cannot volunteer scheduling
   decisions, because cooperative multitasking is the disease this design treats.
3. Wakes from ``BLOCKED`` go to ``READY``, never straight to ``RUNNING``. The
   scheduler decides who runs; a wake only says who *could*.

The suspension stack is LIFO by default, which is ordinary interrupt semantics: the
most recently interrupted job resumes first as higher-priority work drains.

This module owns queue discipline and nothing else. It does not touch the machine,
segments, or the world -- so it can be reasoned about, and tested, on its own.
