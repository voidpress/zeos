"""Page faults: the mechanism that makes retrieval stop being the model's job.

Today's RAG puts recall inside the model's discretion -- the same mistake as polling,
in the other direction. The model must *decide* to look something up, pay a forward
pass to ask, and frequently does not know that it does not know. Under ZEOS a
missing-page reference blocks the job (costing nothing, by pipe semantics), the
kernel fetches, injects, and resumes.

Two fault kinds, both routed here:

* ``FAULT(segment)`` -- the model referenced a stub's handle. Cheap and exact.
* ``NEED(text)`` -- a structured request for content the model believes exists but
  cannot name. Resolved by search, and a NEED the pager cannot satisfy returns a
  kernel notice saying so -- which is itself valuable state, because "we looked and
  it isn't there" is a different belief from "I forgot to look".

**Placement matters as much as retrieval.** Appending the span at the current
boundary costs a prefill and invalidates nothing, and puts the content near the
point of need -- which is also where attention research says it is most usable.
Splicing it back into its original position costs the prefill *plus* everything
downstream, and is only worth it when downstream is short or is being recomputed
anyway.

In M0 the pager is kernel logic. In the design it is an ordinary descriptor --
scheduled, budgeted, and faulted like anything else -- and the escalation path for
*implicit* faults (a watcher that notices unresolved references) is explicitly an
open question (OQ-4), not something this implements.
