"""Bounded token buffers, and the scheduling primitive that eliminates polling.

A pipe is two things at once (core §4), and conflating them deliberately is the
whole trick: it is a channel between jobs, *and* it is how the kernel knows when a
job has nothing to do. A job that blocks on a read runs no forward passes and its
KV becomes eligible for page-out; a write to an empty pipe is a wake event for its
reader. One mechanism serves dataflow, tool completion, and interrupts.

Backpressure is not an error path. A bounded buffer that blocks its writer gives
automatic rate matching between producers and consumers of different speeds, with
zero logic in either descriptor.

Pipes are addressed by **name** and resolved through a transport, so a job cannot
observe whether its peer is in-process or on another node. Phase 1 ships only
``LocalTransport``; this is the seam that makes federation an addition rather than
a redesign.
