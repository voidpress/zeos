"""The process control block.

Descriptor + transcript + kernel metadata = the PCB. KV is a *cache* of the PCB,
not part of it (core §2.1) -- which is why nothing here refers to KV blocks, and why
a job survives a model swap: the transcript is portable state, the KV is a
materialisation of it for one specific model.

The read/write sets carried here are the *observed* ones, accumulated from what the
job actually touched. The union of declared and observed is what resume
invalidation uses (core §3) -- declared sets will be wrong, and the kernel is
expected to notice.
