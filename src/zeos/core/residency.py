"""Eviction, stubs, working sets, and thrash detection.

The window is a cache, not the memory. When residency pressure demands it, the
kernel evicts a cold span to the store and leaves a **stub** in its place -- a
summary *plus a page handle*, which is what distinguishes this from compaction.
Compaction is eviction without an address: the summary replaces the content with no
way back. A stub can be faulted in.

Three things here are easy to get subtly wrong, and each has a rule:

**Stubs do not launder taint.** The framing is ring 0 because the kernel wrote it,
but the summary body inherits the *source* segment's ring and integrity.
Summarising ring-3 content produces ring-3 content. Only an endorser raises
integrity, and a summarizer is not an endorser.

**Eviction can be net-negative.** Replacing an `s`-token span with a `σ`-token stub
frees `s - σ` window tokens, but if the job faults it back in, that cost is
`s/p` prefill plus the fault latency. The clock's skip rule declines evictions
whose expected refault cost exceeds what they free -- which is why a span that is
cold *and small* is often not worth evicting at all.

**A throttled or failed eviction must be visible.** Thrashing is a loud
``SCHEDULER_FAULT``, not a silent churn of SPLICE recomputes. A system that
quietly thrashes looks identical to one that is merely slow.
