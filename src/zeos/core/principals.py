"""Principals: who is asking, and what they are allowed to cause.

The kernel had no answer to "whose job is this?". Every job had a descriptor, a
priority, and a capability table taken wholesale from that descriptor -- which is
fine while the only thing that can start a job is a boot file written by an
engineer, and useless the moment a human can ask for one. ZEOS-NLI puts four
hard gates in front of an utterance and the first two are **authority** and
**priority**; neither has anything to attach to without this module.

The model is deliberately the one from multi-user operating systems, because that
is where the property comes from:

> A dangerous instruction fails the way ``rm -rf /`` fails for a non-root user --
> permission denied, not moral disapproval. The model can be talked into *wanting*
> to comply. It cannot be talked into being *able* to.

Three pieces:

* a **principal envelope** -- an identity plus the authority it carries: which
  pipes it may cause writes to, the most urgent priority it may ask for, and the
  ring its utterances arrive at;
* **elevation** -- sudo. Scoped, time-boxed, loud, and re-authenticated. The
  dangerous operation was never impossible, it was gated on authority instead of
  rhetoric;
* **ownership** -- principals may cancel or deprioritise their *own* jobs and not
  anyone else's, which is what makes "actually, stop" a safe thing to say.

**Two different things are called "principal" in this codebase**, and conflating
them would be a real bug. ``ids.Principal`` is a provenance *class* -- kernel, user,
tool, device, peer job -- stamped onto every INJECT so that content's ring can be
assigned from where it came from. ``PrincipalId`` here is an
*identity*: ``badge:hengel-a``. A pipe has a class; an utterance has both. The class
decides what ring the words are content at; the identity decides what the compiled
job may do.

**Authority is intersected, never unioned.** A compiled job holds the capabilities
its descriptor declares *and* its owner's envelope permits. The descriptor says what
the behaviour needs; the envelope says what this speaker may cause. Taking the union
would mean a visitor could run the barrier-override behaviour by asking for it by
name, which is exactly the property NLI exists to deny.
