"""Time, as data.

The kernel core never reads a wall clock. Both notions of time enter as inputs so
that a run is a pure function of (descriptor tree, event schedule, seed) -- which is
what makes byte-identical replay possible.

Two clocks, because the design needs both and they are not interchangeable:

``token_clock``
    Logical and kernel-wide: the count of tokens the machine has produced or had
    injected, across all jobs. This is the ordering used for ``injected_at``,
    ``last_touch``, segment ranges, and attention EMA horizons -- everything the
    specs measure in tokens rather than seconds. It advances only when the machine
    does work, so it is unaffected by how long the driver took to call us.

``virtual_ns``
    Virtual wall-clock nanoseconds, supplied by the driver. Used only where the
    world's time genuinely matters: deadlines, ``min_interval`` vector throttling,
    and the "Suspended 94s" line in a RESUME notice. In tests the driver
    supplies a scripted schedule; in deployment it supplies the real clock. The
    kernel cannot tell the difference, and that is the point.
