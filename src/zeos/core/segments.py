"""Segments: the unit of protection, provenance, integrity, paging, and attention.

A segment is a contiguous, immutable-once-closed span of a job's token sequence.
The per-job segment table is **kernel state -- part of the PCB, not the context**.
The model cannot read it, cannot write it, and cannot forge it;
that separation is what makes provenance total rather than advisory.

Two invariants carry most of the weight:

**Block alignment by construction.** The kernel closes the open segment and
pads to a block boundary before any operation that needs a clean edge -- a new
source being injected, an eviction, a masking change. Padding costs at most
``block_size - 1`` tokens per boundary event, and boundary events are kernel-
scheduled, so the overhead is bounded and measurable. What it buys is that a
segment maps *exactly* onto a set of KV blocks, which is what lets attention masks
work at block granularity and makes per-segment attention accounting exact rather
than approximate.

**INJECT is the only entry path for foreign tokens.** Every segment that did
not come from the model's own decoding arrived through an INJECT that named its
source pipe. Provenance is therefore total and automatic, with no instrumentation
of the model required -- and no way for content to arrive unattributed.
