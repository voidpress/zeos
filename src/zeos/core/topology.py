"""Nodes, object authority, and the link between them.

The core design describes one kernel on one node. That is enough for supervisory
control of fixed infrastructure, where the compute can sit wherever is convenient,
and it is not enough for robots, for one reason with no way around it: the
interrupt-latency budget targets tens of milliseconds for a pinned handler, and no
off-platform link meets that.

This module holds the declarations that make the split decidable rather than a
matter of taste:

* a **node** is a scheduling domain -- its own priority space, ready queue, and
  suspension stack. Priorities are not comparable across nodes and no attempt
  is made to make them so;
* an **object authority** is which node owns the truth for a piece of world state.
  Authority follows the sensors and actuators: ``robot.*`` is authoritative where
  the robot is;
* a **link** is characterised by one number the network owns, ``rtt_p99``, which is
  compared against a number the safety engineer owns, a vector's deadline. That
  comparison is the whole placement rule.

**RTT_p99, not mean.** The placement rule is explicit, and the reason is worth keeping in view: a
handler whose budget is met on average and missed at the tail has not met its
budget. Radio-linked platforms have heavy-tailed latency distributions, so the
honest consequence is that more runs on-platform than a mean-latency analysis would
suggest.
