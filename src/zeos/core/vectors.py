"""The interrupt vector table.

An interrupt source is a device pipe with a handler descriptor bound to it at a
priority. A write to that pipe makes the handler runnable, which (if it outranks
the running job) preempts within one token boundary. The vector table is therefore
just the table of (pipe → handler, priority) bindings -- one wake mechanism serving
dataflow, tool completion, and interrupts alike (core §4.4).

Storm control is the interesting part, and the policies are not interchangeable:

* ``coalesce`` is **level-triggered**: N pending firings collapse into one dispatch
  that reads the latest value. Correct for sensors, where what matters is the
  current reading and not how many times it changed on the way here.
* ``queue`` is **edge-triggered**: every firing eventually gets its own dispatch,
  serialised. Correct for commands and discrete events, where dropping one loses
  information.
* ``reentrant`` runs instances in parallel, and is only safe when their read/write
  sets are disjoint across instances (core §5.5).

``min_interval`` throttling **retains** the pending firing rather than discarding
it. A throttle that dropped events would silently convert a storm into data loss,
which is the opposite of failing loudly.
