"""The kernel: one step function over a scheduler, pipes, vectors, and a machine.

Single-threaded, no I/O, no wall-clock reads, no randomness that is not seeded, and
every iteration order is explicitly sorted. All time enters as data via
``advance_time``. Those properties -- not literal referential transparency -- are what
the design needs, and what makes a run reproducible from (descriptor tree, scripts,
event schedule, seed).

A note on the deviation from the plan's ``step(state, event) -> (state', effects)``
signature: state is owned by this object and mutated only through the methods below.
Threading an immutable kernel state through every helper would add a great deal of
Python noise for no additional guarantee, since the guarantees that matter
(determinism, replayability, mock-free tests, portability of the core) all follow
from "no I/O, no clock, no unordered iteration" rather than from immutability.
Nothing outside this module may reach in and mutate kernel state.

The quantum is one decode step, which is one token boundary. That is what makes
"preempts within one token boundary" (core §5.2) a checkable property rather than
an aspiration: between a vector firing and its handler being dispatched, at most one
decode of the preempted job may occur -- and in practice, zero.

        -- so there is nothing to spill and nothing to fault back. Handing it to the

        ``STUB_FRAMING_TOKENS + max(2, n // 8)``, which exceeds ``n`` for any span

        What retraction costs is downstream KV, and the region's position is what makes
        that cheap: it was appended at the previous refresh, so the invalidated extent
        is whatever the job has generated *since* -- exactly the interval in which the

        boundary the region was injected at, and the replacement lands there: the
        region really is "rewritten in place" (Appendix C), the tail merely being where
        the place happens to be.

        Above the ratio the old behaviour stands -- revoke ``Perm.W`` and let the copy
