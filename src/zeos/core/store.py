"""The backing store: append-only, content-addressed spans.

``store_id = hash(tokens)``, with the journal mapping ``(job, segment) → store_id``.
Content addressing buys deduplication for free -- across FORKs, and
across jobs holding identical content -- which matters more than it sounds, because
the common case for a fleet is many jobs holding the same org preamble, the same
reference material, and the same safety rules.

The critical property is the one that is easy to get wrong: **archived spans carry
their full segment record.** Ring, integrity, and provenance survive eviction and
reinstatement byte-for-byte. If they did not, eviction would be a laundering
operation -- evict a ring-3 span, page it back in, and watch it return clean -- which
would silently defeat every guarantee Protected Mode makes.

Stdlib-only and pure: this is an in-memory store with the interface a persistent one
would have. Durability is the driver's problem, not the kernel's.
