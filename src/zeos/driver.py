"""The driver: everything the kernel refuses to do.

The kernel reads no clock, touches no file, and performs no I/O. Something has to,
and this is it. The driver owns:

* **time** -- it decides what "now" is and tells the kernel via ``advance_time``;
* **device adapters** -- turning external events into pipe writes (core §4.3);
* **transports** -- polling for anything arriving from a peer node;
* **the journal file** -- the kernel emits events, the driver persists them;
* **the machine's trace** -- after each tick, a machine that can account for its
  own windows is asked to, and the answer goes to a file beside the journal.

Keeping this boundary sharp is what makes the whole thing replayable. In a test the
schedule is a list; in deployment it is a sensor feed; the kernel cannot tell the
difference, so a field incident replays as a test case.

Deliberately synchronous. M0 has no concurrency to manage -- one kernel, one machine,
a scripted event schedule -- and an async runtime here would buy nothing while making
the ordering of external events harder to reason about, which is precisely the thing
determinism depends on.
