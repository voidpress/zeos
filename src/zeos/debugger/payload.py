"""The projection: a case directory and a journal become one JSON object.

Pure, and that is the whole discipline of this module. No I/O, no clock, no
argument that is not already loaded -- ``server.py`` does the reading and the
writing, and the page does the drawing. The arithmetic lives here, where pytest can
reach it, for the same reason the fold lives in ``monitor/state.py`` rather than in
a dashboard.

Two halves, because the two questions have two different sources:

**Structure comes from the case.** The journal cannot answer "which job reads which
pipe": ``DescriptorLoaded`` carries a priority and three booleans, ``PipeCreated``
carries a pipe but not who binds it, and the vector table appears in the journal
only at the moment a vector fires. Bindings, read/write sets, capabilities and maps
are declared and never journalled, so the wiring diagram is a projection of
``CaseBundle`` and nothing else.

**Runtime comes from the journal**, through the existing fold. Frames are
``SystemView`` exactly as ``monitor.fold`` produced them; nothing here recomputes a
kernel fact, and anything this module reported that the journal did not carry would
be a fact nobody could verify after the run.

**Tokens are both.** What is sitting in a pipe right now is state, so it rides in
the frame as ``PipeView.contents``. What a job has said is history, so it rides
beside the frames as a flat log -- see ``_token_log`` for why a history inside a
delta-encoded frame is quadratic. A job's window is rebuilt the same way, from the
operations that changed it (``_context_log``), and ``replay_context`` is the
specification of what the page rebuilds.

Frames are delta-encoded because a run is long and a frame is not small. The
encoding is mechanical -- changed keys, and changed rows of the keyed lists -- and
``apply_delta`` is its documented inverse, tested to reproduce every frame exactly.
That test is what makes the page's merge safe: the browser performs the same
shallow merge, but the proof that the merge is lossless is in Python.
