"""Assembling the page, and serving it. All I/O stops here.

``payload.py`` is a pure function of a loaded case and a journal, and the page is a
pure function of the payload -- which is what lets both be tested without a socket,
and what would let a live run be served later by changing where the records come
from and nothing else.

The page is one shell with three placeholders. Served, ``__DATA__`` is ``null`` and
the page asks for what it needs; exported, the data is inlined and the file needs no
server, no network and no external asset. A recorded run that needs a running
service to be read is not a thing anyone can attach to an issue.

Unlike the general-purpose viewer this pattern comes from, this server publishes
exactly one case and one journal, both fixed when it was constructed. There is no
user-controlled path, so there is no path to traverse out of.
