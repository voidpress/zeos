"""A machine's own account of each window, sampled beside the journal.

The journal counts in kernel words. What the model is fed -- sub-word pieces, chat
framing, how much of it the cache still holds -- is the machine's business. A machine
implementing ``TracesRaw`` is asked after every tick, and what changed is written to a
side file keyed by journal sequence number: a separate machine's account, kept apart
from the byte-identical record the determinism gate compares. ``replay_trace`` is the
specification of how the rows become windows.
