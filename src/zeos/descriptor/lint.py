"""Load-time checks: the compiler errors of the descriptor tree.

Load-time rejection is a category of assurance that prose prompts structurally
cannot provide. The point is not that these checks are
clever -- most are almost trivial -- but that they run *before the robot moves*, and
that a failure is a diff to review rather than an incident to investigate.

Two severities, and the distinction is load-bearing:

* **ERROR** -- the tree will not be run. Reserved for conditions where running would
  violate a guarantee the design claims to enforce (an unpreemptible job that can
  mask interrupts indefinitely; a vector bound to a handler that does not exist).
* **WARNING** -- reported and run anyway. Used where the condition is a smell rather
  than a violation, because a lint that refuses to start over a missing report pipe
  would be a worse default than one that runs and complains.

All three layers' rules are present: core (masking budgets, unknown references),
MP (confused-deputy-by-construction, endorsement schema width), and VM (pinned-only
with on-demand maps, stub budgets, watermark sanity, working-set fit).

    Addressability is opt-in, so deafness is the default -- but a descriptor can opt
    in by mistake, and the two ways of doing so are worth catching separately.

    The first is a safety-tier behaviour declaring a phrasing. The NLI design says no
    user-spawned job may outrank the safety tier; a safety-tier descriptor that
    *can be asked for* has made the tier reachable by voice, which is the property
    the section exists to deny. Note this is not caught by the ceiling check: the
    ceiling stops a user *raising* a job's priority, and does nothing about a
    descriptor whose declared priority is already there.

    The second is an unpreemptible or pinned behaviour declaring one. Those are
    reflex-tier markers, and the NLI design is explicit that reflexes are reached by compiled
    keyword spotting, never by the language path.
