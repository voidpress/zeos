"""In-process transport: everything on one node.

The degenerate case, and the only one that ships in phase 1. Both ends of every
pipe live in the same ``PipeTable``, so delivery is what the table already did and
there is nothing to poll.

Its value is not what it does but where it sits: every pipe is resolved through a
transport, so adding a federated one is an addition rather than a change to the
kernel, the descriptor format, or any job's semantics.
