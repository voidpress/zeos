"""The link: an in-process transport with injected latency and injected loss.

ZEOS-Distributed's D1 milestone, exactly as specified:

> Two kernel instances with distinct priority spaces bridged by an in-process
> transport with injected latency and injected loss. Validates the design's claims (no cross-link
> preemption, replica staleness, partition as suspension) with no
> networking involved -- **and, being deterministic, is replayable, which a real
> network is not.**

That last clause is the reason to build this before D2 rather than after. A real
network reproduces a partition bug approximately; this reproduces it exactly, and
the difference is whether "the reconnection resumed with the wrong dirty set" is a
regression test or an anecdote.

**Determinism therefore constrains the design.** Latency is a function of the
virtual clock the driver supplies, and loss is either an explicit schedule of frame
indices or a seeded counter -- never ``random``. A transport that consulted a global
RNG would make every federated journal unreproducible, which would cost more than
the realism it bought.

**Nothing here is on the kernel's side of the seam.** The kernel writes to a pipe;
if that pipe is carried by the link, the frame lands in this queue; the *driver*
advances the queue and delivers what has arrived. The kernel does no I/O and reads
no clock, so a job still cannot observe which transport carries its pipe -- which is
the constraint ``transport/base.py`` exists to protect.
