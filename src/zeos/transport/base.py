"""Pipe transports -- the distribution seam.

This interface is the whole of phase 1's distribution work, and it is deliberately
small. The claim of the distribution design is that pipes are already the right seam:
they are the only inter-job communication mechanism, and the kernel already chooses
transport per pipe (zero-copy over shared KV when producer and consumer share a
model, text copy otherwise -- core §4.2). "Same node vs. different node" is one more
transport choice behind an interface that already had to exist.

So there is nothing clever here. What matters is the two constraints it enforces:

1. **A job cannot observe which transport carries its pipe.** Pipe operations block
   identically whether the peer is in-process or across a link, so federation
   changes latency, not semantics.
2. **Pipes are addressed by name.** Never by object reference and never by node
   address, so placement can change without touching a descriptor.

Only ``LocalTransport`` ships in phase 1. When a real transport lands, two things
follow from the specs and should be encoded here rather than rediscovered:
zero-copy is impossible across a link (it needs a shared KV materialisation, so
cross-node pipes always fall back to text copy), and inbound traffic must carry its
ring and principal so that provenance survives the hop.
