"""Namespaced world state, and the read/write sets defined over it.

This is what makes selective resume invalidation possible. Descriptors declare the
world state they depend on (``reads``) and may change (``writes``); the kernel also
accumulates what a job actually touched, and the union of declared and observed is
used at resume time (core §3).

Pure and stdlib-only: the kernel core consults this during ``step()``, so it must
not perform I/O or read a clock. Persistence and device adapters live on the driver
side and reach the store only by applying writes.

**Values are strings.** Deliberately, not lazily: threshold evaluation belongs to
device adapters (a gas sensor crossing 25 ppm becomes a pipe write, not a numeric
comparison in the kernel), and what the kernel needs the value *for* -- diffing,
RESUME text, status-region rendering -- is exactly the string a model reads.

**Patterns.** A read/write-set entry is either an exact object name
(``plant.unit_a``) or a namespace wildcard (``plant.*``), which matches any object
under that prefix. Full globbing is deliberately not supported: read/write sets are
a load-time analysis surface, and richer patterns would make
"do these two descriptors conflict?" undecidable at load time for no real gain.
